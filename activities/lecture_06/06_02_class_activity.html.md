# **Part 1:** Exploratory Data Analysis

Before conducting hypothesis tests, we should always explore our data to
understand its characteristics.

Let's calculate summary statistics and create visualizations.

**Activity: Calculate basic summary statistics for pine needle length**


::: {.cell exercise='true'}

```{.r .cell-code}
# YOUR TASK: Calculate summary statistics for pine needle length
# Hint: Use summarize() function to calculate mean, sd, n, etc.

# Create a summary table for all pine needles
pine_summary <- ps_df %>%
  group_by(side) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_length = mean(length_mm, na.rm=TRUE),
    sd_length = sd(length_mm, na.rm=TRUE),
    n = sum(!is.na(length_mm)),
    se_length = sd_length / (n^0.5),
    t_critical = qt(0.975, df = n - 1),  # 95% CI uses 0.975 (two-tailed)
    ci_lower = mean_length - t_critical * se_length,
    ci_upper = mean_length + t_critical * se_length
  )

print(pine_summary)
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}

```
# A tibble: 2 × 8
  side  mean_length sd_length     n se_length t_critical ci_lower ci_upper

# **Part 1:** Visualizing the Data

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Activity: Create visualizations of pine needle length**

Create a histogram and a boxplot to visualize the distribution of pine
needle length values.

::: {.column width="40%"}
Effective data visualization helps us understand:

-   The central tendency
-   The spread of the data
-   Potential outliers
-   Shape of distribution

# Your Task

```{.r .cell-code}
# YOUR TASK: Create a histogram of pine needle length
# Hint: Use ggplot() and geom_histogram()

# Histogram of all pine needle lengths
ggplot(ps_df, aes(x = length_mm, fill = side)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Pine Needle Lengths",
       x = "Length (mm)",

# What is the Effect size or difference in means?

## Practice Exercise: Calculate Effect size

We could also look at the difference in means... some cool code here

# **Part 2:** Conducting the Two-Sample T-Test

**Activity: Conduct a two-sample t-test**

Now we can compare the mean pine needle lengths between sunny and shady
sides.

H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ (The mean needle lengths are equal)

H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂ (The mean needle lengths are different)

Deciding between:

-   Standard t-test (equal variances)
-   Welch's t-test (unequal variances)

# Based on our Levene's test result.


::: {.cell exercise='true'}

```{.r .cell-code}
# YOUR TASK: Conduct a two-sample t-test
# Use var.equal=TRUE for standard t-test or var.equal=FALSE for Welch's t-test

# Standard t-test (if variances are equal)
t_test_result <- t.test(length_mm ~ side, data = ps_df, var.equal = TRUE)
print("Standard two-sample t-test:")
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}

```
[1] "Standard two-sample t-test:"
```


:::

```{.r .cell-code}
print(t_test_result)
```

```

	Two Sample t-test

# What is Power

Statistical power represents the probability of detecting a true effect
(rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false). In this case, with a
power of 97%, there's a 97% chance of detecting a true difference of 30
units between the means of the two groups if such a difference actually
exists.

A power analysis like this is typically done for one of these purposes:

1.  Before data collection to determine required sample size
2.  After a study to evaluate if the sample size was adequate
3.  To determine the minimum detectable effect size with the given
    sample

With 97% power, this test has excellent ability to detect the specified
effect size. Generally, **80% power is considered acceptable**, so 97%
indicates a very well-powered study for detecting a difference of 30mm
between the groups.

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}$$

# Calculate power for detecting a 1 mm difference

# Get sample sizes # note assumes no missing values

                      var(ps_shady_df$length_mm) * (shady_n - 1)) / 
                      (sunny_n + shady_n - 2))

# **Summary and Conclusions**

In this activity, we've:

1.  Formulated hypotheses about pine needle length
2.  Tested assumptions for parametric tests
3.  Conducted a two-sample t-tests
4.  Visualized data using appropriate methods
5.  Learned how to interpret and report t-test results

**Key takeaways:**

-   Always check assumptions before conducting tests
-   Visualize your data to understand patterns
-   Report results comprehensively
-   Consider alternatives when assumptions are violated

# Reflection Questions

After completing the activities, discuss these questions with your
group:

1.  How does sample size affect our confidence in estimating the
    population mean?
2.  Why is the t-distribution more appropriate than the normal
    distribution when working with small samples?
3.  When comparing two populations, what can we learn from looking at
    confidence intervals versus performing a t-test?
4.  How would you explain the concept of statistical significance to
    someone who has never taken a statistics course?
5.  What do we do if assumptions FAIL!!!
