# In-Class Activity 5: Probability and Statistical Inference

## What did we do last time?

In our previous activity, we:

-   Created and interpreted frequency distributions (histograms)
-   Compared data between groups using side-by-side histograms
-   Explored how sample size affects our understanding of populations
-   Created density plots and calculated probabilities

## Today's focus:

Today we'll focus on:

-   t-distribution and when to use it
-   Calculating and interpreting standard error
-   Creating confidence intervals
-   Conducting **one-sample and two-sample t-tests**
-   **Understanding statistical assumptions and their importance**

# Setup

# An issue we have is pseudoreplication

What is our sample unit? branches? needles? trees? sides?

-   We need to get the averages of the data so it is no psudoreplicated!
-   We will group data by group, tree, tree_char, side and take the
    averages and save the average as length_mm
-   We will also need to make dataframes of sunny and shady side of the
    data

# Part 1: Exploring the Data

data.

# Part 3: Testing Assumptions

Before conducting a t-test, we need to check if our data meets the
necessary assumptions:

1.  **Normality**: The data should be approximately normally distributed
2.  **Independence**: Observations should be independent
3.  **No extreme outliers**: Outliers can heavily influence t-test
    results

Let's check the normality assumption for shady needle lengths:

::: callout-tip
## Practice Exercise 2: Checking Normality of all data but does not do by group!


::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# Create a QQ plot to check normality
# QQ plots compare our data to a theoretical normal distribution
# Points should roughly follow the line if data is normally distributed
qqPlot(ps_df$length_mm, 
       main = "QQ Plot for Needle Lengths",
       ylab = "Sample Quantiles")

# Combined Normality Test

Note you can do this a lot easier with piping of the data...

::: callout-tip
## Practice Exercise 12: Test Normality at one time

There are always a lot of ways to do everything in R and is sometimes
frustrating


::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# there are always two ways
# Test for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test for each wind group
# All in one pipeline using tidyverse approach

    shapiro_p_value = shapiro.test(length_mm)$p.value,
    normal_distribution = if_else(shapiro_p_value > 0.05, "Normal", "Non-normal")
    # above wwe are using an ifelse test which is a great oneliner
  )

# Print the results

::: callout-tip
How to interpret these results:

-   The QQ plot: Points should follow the straight line if data is
    normally distributed
-   Shapiro-Wilk test: If p \> 0.05, we don't reject the assumption of
    normality
-   Boxplot: Look for points beyond the whiskers as potential outliers

# Part 4: One-Sample t-Test

```{.r .cell-code}

2.  What was the alternative hypothesis? H1: μ ≠ 15mm
3.  What does the p-value tell us? (Is p \< 0.05?)
4.  Should we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis?
5.  What is the practical interpretation for biologists?

# Part 5: Confidence Intervals

A confidence interval gives us a range of plausible values for the
population mean.

For a 95% confidence interval using the t-distribution:

## $$ 95\% \text{ CI} = \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} $$

Where:

-   \- $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean
-   \- $s$ is the sample standard deviation
-   \- $n$ is the sample size
-   \- $t_{\alpha/2, n-1}$ is the critical t-value with n-1 degrees of
    freedom

::: callout-tip
## Practice Exercise 4: Calculating Confidence Intervals

Let's calculate the 95% confidence interval for shady needle lengths:


::: {.cell}

shady_se <- sd(ps_shady_df$length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)/sum(!is.na(ps_shady_df$length_mm))^.5
shady_n <- sum(!is.na(ps_shady_df$length_mm))

# Find the critical t-value for 95% confidence with n-1 degrees of freedom
# qt(0.975, df) gives the t-value for a 95% confidence interval (two-tailed)
t_critical <- qt(0.975, df = shady_n - 1)
cat("Critical t-value for", shady_n-1, "degrees of freedom:", round(t_critical, 3), "\n")

## Interpretation:

::: callout-tip
Interpret the results:

1.  What was the null hypothesis?
2.  What was the alternative hypothesis?
3.  What does the p-value tell us?
4.  Should we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis?
5.  What is the practical interpretation for botanists?

# Part 8: Communicating Statistical Results

In scientific writing, it's important to report statistical results
clearly and consistently.

Here's a standard format for reporting t-test results:

For a one-sample t-test: "A one-sample t-test showed that the mean
needle length shady side (M = \[mean\], SD = \[sd\]) was
\[significantly/not significantly\] different from 15 mm, t(\[df\]) =
\[t-value\], p = \[p-value\]."

For a two-sample t-test: "A two-sample t-test revealed that pine needle
lengths on the sunny side (M = \[mean1\], SD = \[sd1\]) were
\[significantly/not significantly\] \[longer/shorter\] than on the shady
side (M = \[mean2\], SD = \[sd2\]), t(\[df\]) = \[t-value\], p =
\[p-value\]."

## Practice Exercise 8: Writing Statistical Results

Write properly formatted statements reporting the results of:

1.  The one-sample t-test comparing mean shady needle lenght to 15mm

2.  The two-sample t-test comparing pine needle lengths

3.  The two-sample t-test comparing needle lengths between sides

Remember to include:

-   Means and standard deviations for each group

-   The t-value with degrees of freedom

-   The p-value and whether the result is significant

# Reflection Questions

1.  How does the t-distribution differ from the normal distribution, and
    why does this matter for small samples?
2.  What assumptions must be met to use a t-test, and what alternatives
    exist if these assumptions are violated?
3.  What is the difference between statistical significance and
    practical importance?
4.  How would the confidence interval change if we used a 99% confidence
    level instead of 95%?
5.  How would you explain the concept of a p-value to someone with no
    statistical background?
