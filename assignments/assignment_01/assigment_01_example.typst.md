# Ecological Statistics Assignment 01

The goal of this assignment is to analyze data from Ted Ozersky using the approaches for comparing two samples using some sort of T-Test. Note you may need to use a Two Sample T-Test with or without equal variances, a paired t-Test on the original data or transformed data.

The set up for the analyses - load libraries - read in the data - make transformations up front in this case - you might thing through this and name things so you can copy the whole code chunk for each question ; )

# Question 1: Hypothesis statements:

1.  Question 1: is there a difference in total phosphorus concentrations between winter and summer?

    1.  H~o~: µ𝚫~TPsummer-winter~ = 0

    2.  H~a~: µ𝚫~TPsummer-winter~ ≠ 0

    3.  The null hypothesis tested is that the population mean difference between summer and winter TP values is equal to 0. The alternative hypothesis is that the population mean difference between summer and winter TP values is not equal to zero.

## Data exploration of TP

## two ways to calcualte effect size

#     effect_size = winter_mean - summer_mean
