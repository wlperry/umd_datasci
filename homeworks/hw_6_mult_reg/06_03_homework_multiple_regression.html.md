# Assignment Overview

This homework assignment will test your understanding of **multiple regression analysis** using real lake water quality data from New Zealand. You will analyze the relationships between chlorophyll-a concentrations and nutrient levels in New Zealand lakes, building on the research findings from Abell et al. (2010) on nitrogen and phosphorus limitation in New Zealand freshwater systems. You will apply the statistical concepts from Lecture 11 to understand how multiple predictors influence water quality.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:

1.  **Understand multiple regression concepts and applications**
2.  **Perform correlation analyses between multiple variables**
3.  **Conduct multiple linear regression**
4.  **Test statistical assumptions for multiple regression**
5.  **Interpret multicollinearity and its effects**
6.  **Create publication-quality figures**

## Data Description

The dataset `matched_lakes_data.csv` contains water quality measurements from 111 New Zealand lakes. This dataset represents a carefully matched subset of lakes with complete measurements for all variables. Key variables include:

- `chl_a_mg_m3`: Chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m³) - **Response variable**
- `tp_mg_m3`: Total phosphorus concentration (mg/m³) - **Predictor variable**
- `tn_mg_m3`: Total nitrogen concentration (mg/m³) - **Predictor variable**
- `lake_id`: Unique identifier for each lake

## Important Background

This dataset builds on the work of Abell et al. (2010), who found that New Zealand lakes show different nutrient limitation patterns compared to European lakes. Chlorophyll-a is a key indicator of algal biomass and water quality in lakes. High chlorophyll concentrations often indicate eutrophication (nutrient enrichment) which can lead to algal blooms and poor water quality. In New Zealand freshwater systems, both phosphorus and nitrogen can act as limiting nutrients, making this an ideal system for studying multiple regression relationships.

# Part 3: Correlation Analysis

## 3.1 Correlation Analysis Setup

::: callout-important
## Question 3: Correlation Analysis Setup

**Task:** Before conducting the correlation analysis, clearly state:

1.  **Type of analysis:** What type of statistical test are you using and why?
2.  **Hypotheses:** State your null and alternative hypotheses for each pair
3.  **Assumptions:** List the assumptions for this test
4.  **Variables:** Identify which variables you're analyzing and their measurement scales
5.  **Ecological predictions:** What relationships do you expect based on New Zealand lake ecology?
:::

**Type of Analysis:** This is a Pearson correlation analysis to quantify the strength and direction of linear relationships between chlorophyll-a and the two nutrient variables (phosphorus and nitrogen) in New Zealand lakes. Correlation analysis is appropriate as an initial step before multiple regression to understand the bivariate relationships and assess potential multicollinearity between predictors.

**Hypotheses:** -

- H₀ for chl_a vs tp: ρ = 0 (There is no linear correlation between chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus in New Zealand lakes)

- H₁ for chl_a vs tp: ρ ≠ 0 (There is a significant linear correlation between chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus)

- H₀ for chl_a vs tn: ρ = 0 (There is no linear correlation between chlorophyll-a and total nitrogen in New Zealand lakes)

- H₁ for chl_a vs tn: ρ ≠ 0 (There is a significant linear correlation between chlorophyll-a and total nitrogen)

- H₀ for tp vs tn: ρ = 0 (There is no linear correlation between total phosphorus and total nitrogen)

- H₁ for tp vs tn: ρ ≠ 0 (There is a significant linear correlation between total phosphorus and total nitrogen)

**Assumptions:**

1\. Random sampling from the population of New Zealand lakes

2\. Bivariate normality (both variables normally distributed)

3\. Linear relationship between the variables

4\. Independence of observations (each lake represents an independent sample)

**Variables:**

- Variable 1: Chlorophyll-a concentration (chl_a_mg_m3) - continuous numerical variable (mg/m³)

- Variable 2: Total phosphorus concentration (tp_mg_m3) - continuous numerical variable (mg/m³)

- Variable 3: Total nitrogen concentration (tn_mg_m3) - continuous numerical variable (mg/m³)

## 3.3 Interpret Correlation Results

::: callout-important
## Question 4: Correlation Interpretation

**Task:** Interpret your correlation results by addressing:

1.  **Strength and direction:** How strong are the relationships and in what direction?
2.  **Statistical significance:** Which correlations are statistically significant?
3.  **Ecological significance:** What do these relationships mean for New Zealand lake ecology?
4.  **Multicollinearity concerns:** Are the predictors correlated with each other?

# Part 4: Multiple Regression Analysis

## 4.1 Multiple Regression Analysis Setup

::: callout-important
## Question 5: Multiple Regression Analysis Setup

**Task:** For the multiple regression of chlorophyll on phosphorus and nitrogen, clearly state:

1.  **Type of analysis:** What type of statistical analysis are you using?
2.  **Model equation:** Write out your multiple regression model
3.  **Hypotheses:** State your null and alternative hypotheses
4.  **Variables:** Clearly identify your predictors and response variables
5.  **Biological rationale:** Why use multiple regression for this New Zealand lake question?
:::

**Type of Analysis:** This is multiple linear regression analysis to model chlorophyll-a concentration as a function of both total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations simultaneously in New Zealand lakes. This approach allows us to assess the independent effects of each nutrient while controlling for the other.

**Model Equation:** chl_a_mg_m3 = β₀ + β₁(tp_mg_m3) + β₂(tn_mg_m3) + ε

Where:

- \- chl_a_mg_m3 = chlorophyll-a concentration (response variable)
- \- β₀ = intercept (baseline chlorophyll when both nutrients = 0)
- \- β₁ = partial slope for phosphorus (change in chlorophyll per unit phosphorus, holding nitrogen constant)
- \- β₂ = partial slope for nitrogen (change in chlorophyll per unit nitrogen, holding phosphorus constant)
- \- ε = random error term

**Hypotheses:**

## 4.2 Perform Multiple Regression Analysis

```{.r .cell-code}
# Fit the multiple linear model (untransformed)
```
:::



::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# Create ANOVA table

::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# # Get confidence intervals for parameters
# confint_mr_nz_model <- confint(multiple_reg_nz_model)
# confint_mr_nz_model
```
:::


**Interpretation of Model Output:**

- **Overall Model:**

- **R-squared:**

- **Individual Predictors and significance:**

  - \- Total phosphorus: β₁ = 0.321 (t = 49.0, p \< 0.001)
  - \- Total nitrogen: β₂ =

- **Multicollinearity:** VIF values of 4.1 for both predictors indicate moderate multicollinearity (VIF \> 3 but \< 10), which is expected given the strong correlation between nutrients but not severe enough to compromise the analysis.

## 4.3 Test Regression Assumptions


::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# # Create diagnostic plots

## Data Transformation

Given the assumption violations and the power-law nature of ecological relationships, we'll apply log transformation to all variables to improve normality and homoscedasticity.

## 4.6 Interpret Final Multiple Regression Results

::: callout-important
## Question 6: Multiple Regression Interpretation

**Task:** Provide a complete interpretation of your final (log-transformed) multiple regression results:

1.  **Overall model:** Is the overall model statistically significant?
2.  **Individual predictors:** Which predictors are significant and what are their effects?
3.  **Parameter estimates:** What are the slope estimates and their meanings?
4.  **Model fit:** How much variance is explained (R²)?
5.  **Assumptions:** Were the assumptions met? Any concerns?
6.  **Multicollinearity:** Is multicollinearity a problem?
7.  **Ecological interpretation:** What does this mean for New Zealand lake management?
:::

**Final Model Interpretation:**

**Overall Model:**

**Model Equation:** log(chlorophyll) = ???? + ??? × log(phosphorus) + ??? × log(nitrogen)

**Individual Predictors:**

- \- Log total phosphorus:
- \- Log total nitrogen:

**Parameter Interpretation:** The coefficients represent elasticities: a 1% increase in phosphorus leads to a ????% increase in chlorophyll, while a 1% increase in nitrogen leads to a ???% increase in chlorophyll, holding the other nutrient constant.

what does the above mean?

**Model Fit:** The model explains ???% of variance in log-chlorophyll

**Ecological Interpretation:** Phosphorus has approximately ??? times stronger effect than nitrogen, but both nutrients are highly significant predictors. And what should be controlled
