# Assignment Overview

This homework assignment will test your understanding of correlation and regression analysis using real forest inventory data from European beech (*Fagus sylvatica*) trees. You will apply the statistical concepts from Lectures 9 and 10 to analyze relationships between tree measurements.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:

1.  **Distinguish between correlation and regression analysis**
2.  **Perform and interpret correlation analyses**
3.  **Conduct simple linear regression**
4.  **Test statistical assumptions**
5.  **Create publication-quality figures**

## Data Description

The dataset `fagus_data.csv` contains forest inventory measurements from European beech trees across different regions and time periods. Key variables include:

- `diameter_mm`: Tree diameter at breast height (millimeters)
- `stem_volume_m3`: Calculated stem volume (cubic meters)
- `tree_age`: Estimated tree age (years)
- `year_of_inventory`: Year when measurements were taken
- `region`: Geographic region
- `period`: Time period classification
- `landuse_code`: Land use classification code
- `landuse_char`: Land use description
- `within_formally_protected_areas`: Protection status (0/1)

## Question 1: Summary Statistics

**Task:** Calculate and interpret summary statistics for the three main continuous variables: diameter, volume, and age.

**Instructions:**

- Use appropriate R functions to calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles
- Comment on the distribution shape (symmetric, skewed) based on these statistics
- Identify any potential outliers or unusual values

# Submission Guidelines

## What to turn in -

1.  a quarto markdown file and dataframe. Note that your code should be able to run with what you turn in.

2.  a self-contained word and html file showing the code and output

3.  annotations in the quarto file that shows or tells what is being done in the r code chunks describing what you are trying to do - credit will be given even if it does not work as long as you detail what you are doing. As we start to move into more statistics you will be expected to interpret the results.
